# Company Management
#### Skill Assessment

The challenge will contain a few core features most applications have. That includes basic MVC, exposing an API, CRM like features, and finally tests.

### The application should have the following features:
* Basic Laravel Auth: ability to log in as administrator
* Use database seeds to create first user with email admin@admin.com and password “password”
* CRUD functionality (Create / Read / Update / Delete) for two menu items: Companies and Employees.
* Companies DB table consists of these fields: Name (required), email, logo (minimum 100×100), website
* Employees DB table consists of these fields: First name (required), last name (required), Company (foreign key to Companies), email, phone
* Use database migrations to create those schemas above
* Store companies logos in storage/app/public folder and make them accessible from public
* Use basic Laravel resource controllers with default methods – index, create, store etc.
* Use Laravel’s validation function, using Request classes
* Use Laravel’s pagination for showing Companies/Employees list, 10 entries per page
* Expose and API to list all companies and employees
* Let your creativity run wild and add a feature not mentioned above that you think would be useful for the application

## Instructions (Docker required)
### Cloning the repository
1. Create a bare clone of the repository. (This is temporary and will be removed so just do it wherever.)
    ```bash
    git clone --bare https://github.com/FmTod/skill-assessment-company-management.git
    ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub.

3. Mirror-push your bare clone to your new repository.<br/>_Replace &lt;username&gt; with your actual GitHub username in the url below._<br/>_Replace &lt;repository&gt; with the name of your new repository._
    ```shell
    cd skill-assessment-company-management.git
    git push --mirror https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
    ```
4. Delete the bare clone created in step 1.
    ```shell
    cd ..
    rm -rf skill-assessment-company-management.git
    ```
   
5. You can now clone your repository, where you are going to be working, on your machine (in my case in the code folder).
    ```shell
    cd ~/code
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
    ```

### Getting Started
1. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file as `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell
    docker run --rm \
        -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
        -w /var/www/html \
        laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
        composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
    ```

3. Start the container (Sail):
    ```shell
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```
   
4. Generate a new secret key:
    ```shell
    ./vendor/bin/sail key:generate
    ```
   
5. (IMPORTANT) Edit the README.md file and add your name and email.
    ```diff
    + Name: Dipjyoti Biswas <br/>
    + Email: djbiswasbd@gmail.com <br/>
    ```
   
6. (IMPORTANT) Submit your first commit with just the changes to the README.md file. Must be done before starting the assignment.
    ```shell
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push
    ```
